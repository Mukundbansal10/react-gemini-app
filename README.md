## AI Chatbot using Gemini AI

### Overview
This project is an AI chatbot powered by Gemini AI, a cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) model developed by Google. The chatbot is designed to interact with users, answer their questions, and engage in conversation on various topics.

### Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: The chatbot is capable of understanding natural language input from users, allowing for more human-like interactions.
- **Dynamic Responses**: Responses provided by the chatbot are dynamically generated based on the input received and the context of the conversation.
- **Surprise Me Functionality**: Users can trigger the "Surprise Me" functionality to receive random interesting facts, answers to common questions, or engaging conversation starters.
- **Error Handling**: The chatbot handles errors gracefully and provides helpful error messages when input is invalid or when there are issues processing the request.
- **Chat History**: The chatbot maintains a history of interactions, allowing users to review past conversations and continue the conversation seamlessly.

### Technologies Used
- **Gemini AI**: The core NLP model used for generating responses and understanding user input.
- **React**: The frontend of the chatbot is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Express.js**: The backend server is built using Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js.
- **Cors**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware used to enable cross-origin requests between the frontend and backend.
- **dotenv**: Module used to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for building the server-side logic of the chatbot.
- **Fetch API**: Used to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend server.
